Another shortcut is the Kleene star, expressed by the notation {. . .}*. 

Let us consider the BNF definitions of some other useful sets. Many symbol manipulation
procedures are designed to operate on lists that contain only symbols and other similarly restricted
lists. We formalize this notion with these rules:

<s-list>			::= ({<symbol-expression>}*)
<symbol-expression> ::= <symbol> | <s-list>


<s-list>			::= ()
					::= (<symbol-expression> . <s-list>)
<symbol-expression> ::= <symbol> | <s-list>


Exercise 1.13 [ ] Rewrite the grammar for <s-list> to use Kleene star, and rewrite  notate-depth-
in-s-list using  map.
